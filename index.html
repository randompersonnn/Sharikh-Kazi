        <h2>PIKACHU</h2>
        <img id="two"src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRQeLHsC--S0YnNvs7zPt9TIwp8CDxxqeLu4w&usqp=CAU"ALIGN="left"/><p id="six">Pikachu is the best-known species of Pokémon, largely due to its appearance in the anime series as the starter Pokémon of the protagonist, Ash Ketchum. Pikachu is a major character of the Pokémon franchise as well as its mascot, and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years, as well as one of the major mascots for Nintendo.
        Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Pokémon series began in Japan in 1996, and features several species of creatures called "Pokémon" that players, called "trainers".Initially both Pikachu and the Pokémon Clefairy were chosen to be lead characters for the franchise merchandising, with the latter as the primary mascot to make the early comic book series more "engaging". However, with the production of the animated series, Pikachu was chosen as the primary mascot, in an attempt to appeal to female viewers and their mothers, and because it was believed that Pikachu presented the image of a recognizable intimate pet to children. Its color was also a deciding factor, as yellow is a primary color and easier for children to recognize from a distance, and with consideration to the fact that the only other competing yellow mascot at the time was Winnie-the-Pooh.[14] Though Tajiri acknowledged that the character was relatively popular with both boys and girls, the idea of Pikachu as the mascot was not his own, with the company responsible for the production of the animated series OLM, Inc. giving the suggestion to utilize Pikachu's potential to Game Freak, and stated he felt the human aspect of the series was overlooked by Japanese children who embraced Pikachu by itself more readily.[15][16] Pikachu was originally going to have a second evolution called Gorochu, which was intended to be the evolved form of Raichu.Pikachu's design has evolved from its once-pudgy body to having a slimmer waist, straighter spine, and more defined face and neck; Sugimori has stated these design changes originated in the anime, making Pikachu easier to animate, and were adopted to the games for consistency.[19] "Fat Pikachu" was revisited in Pokémon Sword and Shield, where Pikachu received a Gigantamax Form resembling its original design.[20][21][22] With that Gigantamax Form, Pikachu gains access to the G-Max Move G-Max Volt Crash, which paralyzes all opponents.</p>
<h3>CHARLIZARD</h3>
<img id="two"src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2392268.jpg"height="300px"width="400px"Align="right"/><p id="six">Charizard is featured in the Pokémon anime series with the most recurring being from the main character Ash Ketchum. It is featured in printed adaptations such as Pokémon Adventures, in the possession of Blue, one of the main characters. Charizard appears in Pokémon Origins with main character Red as its trainer. In this series, Charizard is iconic, because it was the first Pokémon to Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X and it helped beat Mewtwo. Charizard has received positive reception from the media, with GamesRadar describing it as "hands-down one of the coolest Pokémon out there". Charizard is the version mascot of Pokémon Red and FireRed versions, and makes an appearance on the boxarts of Pokémon Stadium, Pokémon Ranger, Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team, Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky, and Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon. It has appeared in every entry of the Super Smash Bros. series, in an unplayable capacity in the first two games before becoming a playable character from Super Smash Bros. Brawl onwards. A Charizard also appears in the live-action animated film Detective Pikachu.harizard was designed by Atsuko Nishida and one of the rarest Pokémon in the world, especially with Pokémon collectors. Its cost $200,000 for one Charizard first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized as Pokémon Red and Blue.[1] Charizard was designed before Charmander, the latter being actually based on the former.[4] Originally called "Lizardon" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species "clever and descriptive names" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children.[5] As a result, they were renamed "Charizard", a portmanteau of the words "charcoal" or "char" and "lizard".[6] During an interview, Pokémon Company President Tsunekazu Ishihara stated that Charizard was expected to be popular with North American audiences because of their preference for strong, powerful characters.</p>
<h4>BULBASAUR</h4>
<img id="two"src="https://c3.klipartz.com/pngpicture/247/905/sticker-png-bulbasaur-pokemon-bulbasaur-thumbnail.png"height="200px"width="300px"Align="left"/><p id="six">Bulbasaur was designed by Atsuko Nishida, one of the character designers for Pocket Monsters Red and Blue, who based its design on Venusaur, the fully evoled form of Bulbasaur.[1] The species first appeared as one of three starter Pokémon the player could choose from at the beginning of the initial Game Boy games, Pokémon Red and Blue, released in Japan in 1996.[3] Its Japanese name, Fushigidane (fu-SHI-gi-DON-e), is a combination of the Japanese words for mystery or miracle (fushigi) and seed (tane).[4] In translating the game for English speaking audiences, Nintendo gave the Pokémon "cleverly descriptive names" related to their appearance or features as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children; thus Bulbasaur, a portmanteau relating to both its dinosaurian appearance and the large garlic-shaped bulb on its back.[5] The idea to feature Bulbasaur and the other Red and Blue starters in a significant role in Pokémon X and Y came about a year and a half into the development of the games. The Mega Evolutions for the three Pokémon's final forms were created, and the designers decided that they should give players an opportunity to receive one of these Pokémon from Professor Sycamore, the games professor, to see their Mega Evolved form.
Despite their English names, Ken Sugimori confirmed that the design of Bulbasaur and its evolutions are based on onions and frogs,[7] albeit identified more with a smaller Dicynodont. In the Pokémon franchise, Bulbasaur are small, squat amphibian and plant Pokémon that move on all four legs, and have light blue-green bodies with darker blue-green spots. As a Bulbasaur undergoes evolution into Ivysaur and then later into Venusaur, the bulb on its back blossoms into a large flower.[8] The seed on a Bulbasaur's back is planted at birth and then sprouts and grows larger as the Bulbasaur grows.[9] The bulb absorbs sunlight which allows it to grow, and for this reason, Bulbasaur enjoy soaking up the sun's rays. [10] They can also survive for days without eating because the bulb stores energy.[11] The distinctive differences of Bulbasaur from other Pokémon such as Diglett are well understood by children and so motivate their play and trading of the creature.</p>
<h5>BLASTOISE</h5>
<img id="two"src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/55/6a/99/556a990cb624988b65136f083d5ba906.png"height="200px"width="300px"Align="left"/><p id="six">Blastoise was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue.[1][2] Originally called "Kamex" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species turtle like actions such as shelling and "clever and descriptive names" in relation to their appearances or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable outside of Japan.[3]
Gigantamax Blastoise
Known as the Shell Pokémon, Blastoise is the final stage in Squirtle’s evolutionary line. It. takes on an appearance radically different from its previous forms; the most obvious change is the addition of two retractable cannons on its shell. It is also a larger and more imposing figure, as the shape of its head is completely reformed and its limbs are stout and segmented, bearing visible claws, and its once sought-after tail is short and somewhat stubby. The afore-mentioned cannon spouts are remarkable adaptations, allowing a Blastoise to shoot water with great power and accuracy. The jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel,[4] while their bullets of water can precisely nail tin cans from a distance of over 160 feet.[5] The spouts also allow for high-speed tackles.[6] Despite being large and heavy, Blastoise can still move well on either two legs or all fours. Blastoise can be found living on island beaches near the ocean, but their preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. It is widely accepted that Blastoise fares better in battle when trained by those viewed in more of a fatherly light. Equipping Blastoise with a Blastoisite can evolve it into Mega Blastoise, which merges the two cannons on its back into a singular large cannon, and adds additional cannons attached to its arms.
In Pokémon Sword and Shield, Blastoise received a Gigantamax form with access to the unique G-Max Move G-Max Cannonade. Gigantamax Blastoise has 31 variously-sized cannons, with legend saying the main cannon can blast holes into mountains.</p>
<h6>DARK RAI</h6>
<img id="two"src="https://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/large/darkrai.jpg"height="300px"width="400px"Align="right"/>
<p id="six">Darkrai was first seen in a garden in Alamos Town. When multiple pillars were knocked over, Baron Alberto accused Darkrai as being responsible for the damage. It mysteriously appeared out of the ground and told everyone to not come there. When Baron Alberto sent out Lickilicky to battle it, it dodged by becoming invisible, then used Dark Void, which ended up hitting Ash. In Ash's nightmare, it showed Ash a vision of Palkia. It then brought Pikachu into a vortex which Ash ended up in until he was awoken.

    Darkrai appeared again briefly after Palkia caused a harsh distortion in space around Alamos Town. It also subtly told Palkia to leave the city. Baron Alberto, still thinking that Darkrai was evil, battled using Lickilicky. Darkrai, however, dodged and used Shock Wave on Lickilicky. Dawn also used Buizel to battle, but Darkrai dodged all the attacks. Soon, Darkrai unleashed several Dark Voids which put several people and Pokémon to sleep. Ash then gave chase to Darkrai and attempted to attack it, but Darkrai instantly vanished. Pikachu then attacked Darkrai's shadow while it was beneath the ground, which caused it to appear. It then used Double Team to dodge Volt Tackle. When Ash told Darkrai that it should leave, it told him that it is staying. Baron Alberto, along with Team Rocket, appeared on the scene. However, Darkrai used Dark Void on Lickilicky. With Darkrai's power, Baron Alberto morphed into a Lickilicky due to his wish to battle Darkrai. It was also revealed that many of the incapacitated Pokémon became ghostly mirages, which ran around revealing that they were being chased by something frightening in the dream world.
    arkrai was mistaken as evil during the movie, attacking people and giving them nightmares. Baron Alberto in particular constantly accused Darkrai of all the anomalies occurring in Alamos Town. It was only later that it was revealed that Darkrai was actually trying to prevent Palkia and Dialga from destroying Alamos Town.

    Darkrai had a special attachment to Alice as it believed she was Alicia, Alice's grandmother, who helped Darkrai when it was injured a long time ago. Ever since then it had stayed in that garden. It also once saved Alice after she fell off a cliff.</p>
